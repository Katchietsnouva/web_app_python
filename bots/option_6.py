# Integration with AI/ML Models:

# Integrate your Selenium script with AI or Machine Learning models.
# For example, use image recognition to interact with elements or predict actions based on website behavior.

# 6. Data Entry Automation:

from selenium import webdriver

# Set up WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("your_form_url")

# Fill out a form
# ...

# Submit the form

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
