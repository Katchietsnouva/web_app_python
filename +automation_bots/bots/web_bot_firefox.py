# Selenium WebDriver is a powerful tool that can be used to interact with web browsers programmatically. While it is commonly used with browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, it is also possible to use it with Brave. To do this, you will need to install the Selenium WebDriver for Brave plugin and configure your WebDriver to use Brave. Once you have done this, you will be able to write scripts that can interact with web pages in Brave just like you would with any other browser. Some examples of things you can do with Selenium WebDriver in Brave include automating form filling and clicking buttons, scraping data from web pages, and testing web applications.

from selenium import webdriver

# Using the Firefox browser with Marionette
driver = webdriver.Firefox()
# webdriver.
# Navigate to a website
driver.get("https://example.com")

# Perform interactions or assertions as needed

# Close the browser window
driver.quit()
