# 15. Browser Game Automation:


# Replace "game_url", "game_element_1", "game_element_2", and "game_element_3" with the actual URL of your game and the appropriate element locators.
# The automate_game function simulates a series of clicks on game elements. Adjust the logic based on the specific actions you need to perform in your game.
# The ActionChains class from Selenium is used to chain together a series of actions.
# Note: Game automation may be subject to the terms of service of the game platform, and it's essential to ensure compliance with the platform's policies.

    game_element_2 = driver.find_element_by_id("game_element_2")
    game_element_3 = driver.find_element_by_id("game_element_3")
